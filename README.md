How to Run : 
1) Make sure the images, findNuclei.m, and runResults.m are in the same
folder.
2) Open runResults.m in matlab, and just run the code. There shuld be
several images popping up, along with the image analysis histograms.
3) If you would like to pass another image through, go to the runResults.m,
call the findNuclei.m function, and pass the image as a parameter.
