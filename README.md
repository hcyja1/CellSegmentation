How to Run : 
1) Make sure the images, findNuclei.m, and runResults.m are in the same
folder.
2) Open runResults.m in matlab, and just run the code. There shuld be
several images popping up, along with the image analysis histograms.
3) If you would like to pass another image through, go to the runResults.m,
call the findNuclei.m function, and pass the image as a parameter.

Please Note : 
1) There is another folder called "Images", whereby i have saved the image of
each process and properly put them in individual folders with labels. 

2) I have left the alternative methods as comments within the
findNuclei.m. This is evidence that I have tested the filters 1 by 1 
to choose the best possible solution I could think of at the time, and also
to do some research to read the properties of the filters.
